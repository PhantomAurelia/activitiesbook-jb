# Week 15

Several ways of reference things and citations have been research.

## Fullfield Activities:

* Update Zotero reference archive
* Search for different ways of reference and cite text in Jupyter Books.

## Known Troubles and how they were solved:

* There are different ways of in-page reference, but I don't think any of them suite a good style of referencing.


## Unfinished Activities:

* Placing reference titles at the bottom of the page.

### Plan for next week:
