# Week 19

A way to hide the year of a reference was found.

## Fullfield Activities:



## Known Troubles and how they were solved:




## Unfinished Activities:



### Plan for next week:

* Adding "cite:authorpar" and "cite:authorpars" to the references that don't need to have a year (like the web page of R).
* Continue serching plugins to add a download link to files.
* Start thinking in the structure of the FDP.
