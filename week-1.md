# Week 1

This week, the creation of a first sample of a Jupyter Book has been committed. In addition to that, a Zotero account has been created in order to have a site in which store all references, bookmarks, etc. to make the project.

## Fullfield Activities:

\-Create a Zotero\[1] account and install the program, adding Antonio to the Group of people able to see and edit the references.(eta. :10min. - diff.: easy)

\-Install Miniforge 3 \[2] to be able to build and create the jupyter book and its necessary files. (eta.: 10 min. - diff.: easy)

\-Install the Jupyter environment and follow the first tutorial \[3]\(ended up in the “Publish your book online”, to not make a GitHub account and then use GitLab, or vice versa). (eta.: 1h - diff.: easy)

## Known Troubles and how they were solved:

\-First thought of the conda command not being recognised by the PowerShell or CMD terminals, ended up in me installing WSL and then having to reset the PC to the previous state.

\-Second thought was to install a Linux system, in which I’m used to using the terminal and some commands, but I didn’t do that. After reinstalling Miniforge3, I saw the Miniforge prompt appear in the windows program menu, and then it was everything very straight forward.

## Unfinished Activities:

\-The Jupyter tutorial has not been finished because of the creation of a GitHub account. Process paused until Antonio’s decision about the platform in which the account will be made.
