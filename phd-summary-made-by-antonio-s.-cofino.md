Title: Executable Book for the Climate Change ATLAS

Summary:

Internationally-coordinated climate model intercomparison projects (MIPs) explore the uncertainties inherent to climate change science. The Multi-MIP Climate Change ATLAS repository \[1] is the backbone of the Sixth IPCC Assessment Report (AR6) Atlas Chapter, which provides a region-by-region assessment of climate change including also the innovative Interactive Atlas \[2]. The Interactive Atlas complements the report by providing flexible spatial and temporal analyses of regional climate change, based on different MIPs.

The IPCC AR6 promotes best practises in traceability and reproducibility of the results shown in the report, including the adoption of the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles for scientific data. In particular, reproducibility and reusability are central in order to ensure the transparency of the final products. The ATLAS products are generated using free software community tools, based on the climate4R framework \[3], for data post-processing (data access, regridding, aggregation, bias adjustment, etc.), evaluation and quality control (when applicable). All of the ATLAS code is made publicly available as notebooks and scripts \[1].

The Executable Book Project (EBP) \[4] is an international collaboration between several universities and open source projects, to build tools that facilitate computational narratives (books, lectures, articles, etc …) using open source tools allowing users from scientific and academic communities to be able to: merge rich text content, output from running code, references, cross-references, equations, images, etc; execute content and cache results; combine into a document model, cached outputs and content files; build interactive (i.e. HTML) and publication-quality (PDF) outputs; and control everything from a simple interface.

In this Final Degree Project, the student will create and combine of code scripts and notebooks from the Multi-MIP Climate Change ATLAS into a computational book to improve the reproducibility and reusability by means of the EBP principles.
