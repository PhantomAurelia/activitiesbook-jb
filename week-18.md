# Week 18

A try in connecting Zotero with Visual Studio code was commited.

## Fullfield Activities:

* Find a way to mantain the references file updated.

## Known Troubles and how they were solved:

Different plugins from VSCode were unnable to link to Zotero due to a proxy problem. The solution came with an extension from Zotero called Better BiBTex, which can update the reference file any time there's a change in content.


## Unfinished Activities:



### Plan for next week:

* Continue making the bibliography.
* Begin hidding the outputs from the code cells of the notebooks.
* Search a way to insert a download button for tables or anything wanted to be downloaded.
