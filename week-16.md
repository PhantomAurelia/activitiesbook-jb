# Week 16

This week and the ones from july and august were a bit lite due to the summer hollydays. References start to appear in the correct form.

## Fullfield Activities:

* Starting a new collection of zotero for the book's references.
* Start searching different ways to referenciate non ".md" or ".ipynb" files in the text.

## Known Troubles and how they were solved:

* Due to an error, the hole system had to be installed again.


## Unfinished Activities:

* Finishing the collection.
* Complete the references.

### Plan for next week:
